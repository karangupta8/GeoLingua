## **Origin**

### **Initial Concept (2015 ‚Äì 2017)**

The idea sparked while I was learning Spanish on Duolingo around 2015. I realized how widely Spanish, Hindi, and English are spoken ‚Äî and that by learning just these, I could communicate with nearly half the global population.

This led to a vision: a platform where users could input the languages they speak and instantly visualize their communication reach ‚Äî using heatmaps, population percentages, and interactive country-level stats. Back then, with limited mobile data and no real-time translation tools, it also seemed like a useful travel planner for language-ready destinations.

### **Inspiration**

- [`tiii.me`](https://tiii.me) ‚Äì A minimal tool to calculate time spent watching TV shows, which inspired a similarly simple and powerful interaction model.

### **Why I Couldn't Build It Then**

I lacked full-stack development skills at the time. Today, with the rise of tools like **Lovable** and AI-powered coding workflows, the idea can finally be executed.

|----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Ethnologue     | Rich language database                  | Static, not interactive or visual        |
| Duolingo Stats | Speaker numbers for popular languages   | No global visualizations                 |
| WorldPop       | Geographic demographic data             | Not language-specific                    |


### **How GeoLingua Stands Out**

* üåç Interactive maps > static tables.
* ‚ûï Multi-language combo calculations.
* üéØ Focuses on practical insights for learners and travelers not just linguistic statistics.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Built for modern UI/UX with real-time interaction and heatmaps.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

**GeoLingua** is a React-based web application that visualizes global language distribution through interactive 3D maps and statistical dashboards.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Graphics**: React Three Fiber + Three.js + React Three Drei
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks + custom service layer
- **Data Format**: Static JSON with language and geographic data

### Data Pipeline

**Language Data Service**
- Language data is served from static JSON files in `/public/data/languages.json`
- `LanguageService` provides caching layer and API abstraction
- Data structure includes speaker counts, country distributions, and geographic coordinates
- Custom hooks (`useLanguages`) manage async data fetching and state

**3D Globe Integration**
- User language selections trigger real-time data filtering
- Geographic coordinates are mapped to 3D sphere positions using spherical coordinate conversion
- Country markers are dynamically positioned and colored based on language coverage intensity
- Language connection arcs are generated between countries sharing selected languages

**Visual Output System**
- Country intensity calculated from speaker percentages (0-100%)
- Color gradients represent language coverage: green (low) ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red (high)
- Day/night textures simulate realistic Earth appearance with dynamic lighting
- Atmospheric glow and country borders enhance visual appeal
- Smooth animations and interactions provide responsive user experience

### Performance Optimizations

- Texture caching and memoization for 3D rendering
- Efficient re-rendering through React optimization patterns
- Level-of-detail scaling for country markers based on coverage
- Debounced user interactions to prevent excessive re-calculations

## üõ† Built With
* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Other Tools:** Lovable, shadcn-ui, Gemini CLI

## üß† Lovable¬†Prompt

Build a modern web app that visualizes the global reach of languages. A user can select one or more languages they speak (or are learning) and instantly see:
- A world map heatmap highlighting regions where the language is spoken, color-coded by the percentage of the population.
- Key stats like total number of speakers, number of countries, and global population coverage.
- A country-wise breakdown (official language status, % speakers, and cultural notes).
The app should feature an intuitive dashboard with interactive maps, charts, and comparisons. It should answer questions like:
‚ÄòIf I know English and Spanish, how many people can I communicate with globally?‚Äô
